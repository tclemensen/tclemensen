- Hi, I’m @tclemensen
- I’m interested in data collection, statistics, automation, smart homes, math problems, IoT, and more.
- I’m currently (re-)learning C# and Python. 
- Not actively looking for collaboraion projects, but I don't rule anything out. Just keep in mind that I am not an expert.
- How to reach me -- Click on my Twitter or Mastodon (2nd link) thingie on the side there and send me a message there. 
- .
- As it stands, I have no projects that I'm really committed to. I am currently in a learning process, taking up 
- coding again after a very long break (15+ years), so essentially I'm re-learning everything.
- ..
- I am mostly using my own Git server these days, so don't expect a lot of updates here, unless I make a project I am
- especially satisfied with ;-)
