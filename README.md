- 👋 Hi, I’m @tclemensen
- 👀 I’m interested in data collection, statistics, automation, smart homes, math problems, IoT, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently (re-)learning C# and Python. 
- 💞️ Not actively looking for collaboraion projects, but I don't rule anything out. Just keep in mind that I am not an expert.
- 📫 How to reach me -- Click on my Twitter thingie there on the side, and send me a message there, or on Mastodon (2nd link). 
- .
- As it stands, I have no projects that I'm really committed to. I am currently in a learning process, taking up 
- coding again after a very long break (15+ years), so essentially I'm re-learning everything.
