- 👋 Hi, I’m @tclemensen
- 👀 I’m interested in data collection, automation, smart homes, math problems, IoT, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Python. Will move on to Java, and possibly JavaScript, later on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. 
- 📫 How to reach me -- 
- .
- As it stands, I have no projects that I'm really committed to. I am currently in a learning process, taking up 
- coding again after a very long break (15+ years), so essentially I'm re-learning everything.
